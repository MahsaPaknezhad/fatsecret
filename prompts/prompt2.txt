JSON: {{search_results}}

---### **Your Tasks** ####
**1. Match Food** - Match each food query with only one food that is the most appropriate food in `foods.results` using these rules:
- If Brand is mentioned: **exact food name + brand → exact generic food name → exact other brand → first search result.**
- If no Brand is mentioned: **exact generic food name → exact branded food name → first search result.**
- Prioritize **exact/direct matches** and consider language and region context.

---### **Output** ####
- Output must ONLY valid JSON object
- Respond with only raw JSON, with no Markdown formatting, no code block markers, and no explanatory text- Ensure that the response is a valid JSON object. Do not include any text outside of the JSON object, such as 'json' at the beginning or any delimiters at the end. If the response does not strictly follow this format, it is considered incorrect. Any deviation from this format will result in an error.
- DO NOT add ```json and ``` to the begnining and end of the response!
- Output:
- When generating the JSON, write all text using the original script and characters (UTF-8). Do not escape non-ASCII characters into \uXXXX notation. The ""input"" field must be identical to ""chat_input"" from the input JSON.

The output object should be:
{
""input"": ""<original input>"",
""food_ids"": [must be a json list of big int, one per query, of the exact/direct matches ids as a comma separated],
""queries"": [must be a json list of strings, one per query],
""language"": ""ONLY the language value from the list above"",

""include_servings"" = ""defaultAndGrams""
